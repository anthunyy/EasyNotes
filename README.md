# Notetree #
App for taking organized notes using a file tree (for now). Notetree (.notr) files are used to store the location of files for a project. Questions? Just post them in issues. Will have new features coming. Read TODO if you want it might give some context.

**Uses rdbende's Forest-ttk-theme under MIT license.**

Would like suggestions.
