TODO:

Main:
- Add way to edit file and category names
- Cleanup code and comments
- Remove ugly bar above tree
- Add more icons and make things overall look nicer
- Fix dupe filenames "bug"
- Make distrabutable somehow
- Eventually get official icons so they are not just pulled from internet
- More
- Add way to get suggestions/report issues (low priority)

Wishlist:
- Make it read md files
- Make it able to open files to serve as a sort of project hub
- Add settings?
- Have notr files serve as a refrence where if you do not have the files, it can provide a link to download them. This would serve as a way for projects to be shared. 
- Add a website and donation page if it gets any actual users.
- More to come
